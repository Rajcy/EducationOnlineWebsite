                            <p>Welcome to our mini series on getting started with programming in Swift!</p>
                            <p>In this series, you&#8217;ll learn some of the basics of programming while working in a
                                modern, friendly environment with the Swift programming language.</p>
                            <p>Instead of boring you with a lot of theory, we&#8217;re going to get you coding right
                                away by using Xcode <em>playgrounds</em>, which are sandbox-type environments where you
                                can run code directly without having to code an entire app.</p>
                            <p>For this tutorial, you&#8217;ll need <em>Xcode 8</em>, the standard development
                                environment for macOS, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">available here</a>.
                                If you have Xcode version 7 or below, some of the code in this tutorial won&#8217;t work
                                as expected.</p>
                            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                            <p>The set of tools you use to write software is often referred to as the <em>toolchain</em>.
                                The part of the toolchain into which you write your code is known as the <em>Integrated
                                    Development Environment</em> (<em>IDE</em>). Xcode is your IDE, which includes
                                playgrounds.</p>
                            <p>You’ll use playgrounds throughout this series to practice coding, so it’s important to
                                understand how they work. That’s what you’ll learn during the rest of this tutorial.</p>
                            <h2>Creating a Playground</h2>
                            <p>When you open Xcode, it will greet you with the following welcome screen:</p>
                            <p><img
                                src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/welcome_to_xcode-650x381.png"
                                alt="welcome_to_xcode" width="650" height="381"
                                class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-143774"
                                srcset="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/welcome_to_xcode-650x381.png 650w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/welcome_to_xcode-480x282.png 480w"
                                sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"/></p>
                            <p>If you don’t see this screen, it’s most likely because the “Show this window when Xcode
                                launches” option was unchecked. You can also open the screen by pressing <em>Command-Shift-1</em>
                                or clicking <em>Window</em><em>\</em><em>Welcome to Xcode</em> from the menu bar.</p>
                            <p>From the welcome screen, you can jump quickly into a playground by clicking on <em>Get
                                started with a playground</em>. Click on that now and Xcode will take you to a new
                                screen:</p>
                            <p><img
                                src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/new_playground-650x416.png"
                                alt="new_playground" width="650" height="416"
                                class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-143775"
                                srcset="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/new_playground-650x416.png 650w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/new_playground-480x308.png 480w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/new_playground.png 960w"

                            <p>From here, you can name the playground and select your desired platform. The name is
                                merely cosmetic and for your own use; when you create your playgrounds, feel free to
                                choose names that will help you remember what they’re about.</p>
                            <p>The second option you can see here is the platform. Currently, this can be either
                                <em>iOS</em>, <em>macOS</em> or <em>tvOS</em>.</p>
                            <p>The platform you choose simply defines which template Xcode will use to create the
                                playground. Each platform comes with its own environment set up and ready for you to
                                begin playing around with code. For the purposes of this seris, choose whichever you
                                wish. You won’t be writing any platform-specific code; instead, you’ll be learning the
                                core principles of the Swift language.</p>
                            <p>Once you’ve chosen a name and a platform, click on <em>Next</em> and then save the
                                playground. Xcode then presents you with the playground, like so:</p>
                            <p><img
                                src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/empty_playground-650x356.png"

                                class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-143776"
                                srcset="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/empty_playground-650x356.png 650w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/empty_playground-480x263.png 480w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/empty_playground.png 960w"
                                sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"/></p>
                            <p>New playgrounds don’t start entirely empty but have some basic starter code to get you
                                going. Don’t worry — you’ll soon learn what this code means.</p>
                            <h3>Playgrounds Overview</h3>
                            <p>At first glance, a playground may look like a rather fancy text editor. Well, here’s some
                                news for you: It is essentially just that!</p>
                            <p><img
                                src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/playground_features-650x419.png"
                                alt="playground_features" width="650" height="419"
                                class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-143779"
                                srcset="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/playground_features-650x419.png 650w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/playground_features-480x310.png 480w"

                            <p>The above screenshot highlights the first and most important things to know about:</p>
                            <ol start="1">
                                <li>
                                    <em>Source editor</em>: This is the area in which you’ll write your Swift code. It’s
                                    much like a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. You’ll notice the use of what’s
                                    known as a monospace font, meaning all characters are the same width. This makes the
                                    code much easier to read and format.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>Results sidebar</em>: This area shows the results of your code. You’ll learn
                                    more about how code is executed as you read through the series. The results sidebar
                                    will be the main place you’ll look to confirm your code is working as expected.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>Execution control</em>: Playgrounds execute automatically by default, meaning
                                    you can write code and immediately see the output. This control allows you to
                                    execute the playground again. Holding down the button allows you to switch between
                                    automatic execution and manual execution modes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>Activity viewer</em>: This shows the status of the playground. In the
                                    screenshot, it shows that the playground has finished executing and is ready to
                                    handle more code in the source editor. When the playground is executing, this viewer
                                    will indicate this with a spinner.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <em>Panel controls</em>: These toggle switches show and hide three panels, one that
                                    appears on the left, one on the bottom and one on the right. The panels each display
                                    extra information that you may need to access from time to time. You’ll usually keep
                                    them hidden, as they are in the screenshot. You’ll learn more about each of these
                                    panels as you move through the series.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Playgrounds execute the code in the source editor from top to bottom. Every time you
                                change the code, the playground will re-execute everything. You can also force a
                                re-execution by clicking <em>Editor</em><em>\</em><em>Execute Playground</em>.
                                Alternatively, you can use the execution control.</p>
                            <p>You can turn on line numbers on the left side of the source editor by clicking
                                <em>Xcode</em><em>\</em><em>Preferences&#8230;</em><em>\</em><em>Text
                                    Editing</em><em>\</em><em>Line Numbers</em>. Line numbers can be very useful when
                                you want to refer to parts of your code.</p>
                            <p>Once the playground execution is finished, Xcode updates the results sidebar to show the
                                results of the corresponding line in the source editor. You’ll see how to interpret the
                                results of your code as you work through the examples in this series.</p>
                            <p>Code comments, arithmetic operations, constants and variables are some of the fundamental
                                building blocks of any language, and Swift is no different.</p>
                            <h2>Code Comments</h2>
                            <p>The Swift compiler generates executable code from your source code. To accomplish this,
                                it uses a detailed set of rules. Sometimes these details can obscure the big picture of
                                <em>why</em> you wrote your code a certain way or even what problem you are solving. To
                                prevent this, it’s good to document what you wrote so that the next human who passes by
                                will be able to make sense of your work. That next human, after all, may be a future
                                you! :]</p>
                            <p>Swift, like most other programming languages, allows you to document your code through
                                the use of what are called <em>comments</em>. These allow you to write any text directly
                                along side your code, which is ignored by the compiler.</p>
                            <p>The first way to write a comment is like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
// This is a comment. It is not executed.
</pre>
                            <p>This is a <em>single line comment</em>. You could stack these up like so to allow you to
                                write paragraphs:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
// This is also a comment.
// Over multiple lines.
</pre>
                            <p>However, there is a better way to write comments which span multiple lines. Like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
/* This is also a comment.
   Over many..
   many...
   many lines. */
</pre>
                            <p>This is a <em>multi-line comment</em>. The start is denoted by <code>/*</code> and the
                                end is denoted by <code>*/</code>. Simple!</p>
                            <p>You should use code comments where necessary to document your code, explain your
                                reasoning, or simply to leave jokes for your colleagues. :]</p>
                            <h2>Printing Out</h2>
                            <p>It’s also useful to see the results of what your code is doing. In Swift, you can achieve
                                this through the use of the <code>print</code> command.</p>
                            <p><code>print</code> will output whatever you want to the <em>debug area</em> (sometimes
                                referred to as the console).</p>
                            <p>For example, consider the following code:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
print(&quot;Hello, Swift Apprentice reader!&quot;)
</pre>
                            <p>This will output a nice message to the debug area, like so:</p>
                            <p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/printing-650x304.png"

                                picture above. You can also click <em>View</em><em>\</em><em>Debug
                                    Area</em><em>\</em><em>Show Debug Area</em> to do the same thing.</p>
                            <h2>Arithmetic Operations</h2>
                            <p>When you take one or more pieces of data and turn them into another piece of data, this
                                is known as an <em>operation</em>.</p>
                            <p>The simplest way to understand operations is to think about arithmetic. The addition
                                operation takes two numbers and converts them into the sum of the two numbers. The
                                subtraction operation takes two numbers and converts them into the difference of the two
                                numbers.</p>
                            <p>You’ll find simple arithmetic all over your apps; from tallying the number of “likes” on
                                a post, to calculating the correct size and position of a button or a window, numbers
                                are indeed everywhere!</p>
                            <p>In this section, you’ll learn about the various arithmetic operations that Swift has to
                                offer by considering how they apply to numbers. In later parts, you see operations for
                                types other than numbers.</p>
                            <h3>Simple Operations</h3>
                            <p>All operations in Swift use a symbol known as the <em>operator</em> to denote the type of
                                operation they perform.</p>
                            <p>Consider the four arithmetic operations you learned in your early school days: addition,
                                subtraction, multiplication and division. For these simple operations, Swift uses the
                                following operators:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Add: <code>+</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Subtract: <code>-</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Multiply: <code>*</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Divide: <code>/</code>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These operators are used like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
2 + 6

10 - 2

2 * 4

24 / 3
</pre>
                            <p>Each of these lines is what is known as an <em>expression</em>. An expression has a
                                value. In these cases, all four expressions have the same value: 8. You write the code
                                to perform these arithmetic operations much as you would write it if you were using pen
                                and paper.</p>
                            <p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/broken_paper.png"

                            <p>In your playground, you can see the values of these expressions in the right-hand bar,
                                known as the <em>results sidebar</em>, like so:</p>
                            <p><img
                                src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/arithmetic_operations-650x304.png"
                                alt="arithmetic_operations" width="650" height="304"

                                srcset="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/arithmetic_operations-650x304.png 650w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/arithmetic_operations-480x225.png 480w"
                                sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"/></p>
                            <p>If you want, you can remove the white space surrounding the operator:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
2+6
</pre>
                            <p>Removing the whitespace is an all or nothing thing: you can&#8217;t mix styles. For
                                example:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
2+6   // OK
2 + 6 // OK
2 +6  // ERROR
2+ 6  // ERROR
</pre>
                            <p>It’s often easier to read expressions if you have white space on either side of the
                                operator.</p>
                            <h3>Decimal Numbers</h3>
                            <p>All of the operations above have used whole numbers, more formally known as
                                <em>integers</em>. However, as you will know, not every number is whole.</p>
                            <p>As an example, consider the following:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
22 / 7
</pre>
                            <p>This, you may be surprised to know, results in the number 3. This is because if you only
                                use integers in your expression, Swift makes the result an integer also. In this case,
                                the result is rounded down to the next integer.</p>
                            <p>You can tell Swift to use decimal numbers by changing it to the following:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
22.0 / 7.0
</pre>
                            <p>This time, the result is 3.142857142857143 as expected.</p>
                            <h3>The Remainder Operation</h3>
                            <p>The four operations you’ve seen so far are easy to understand because you’ve been doing
                                them for most of your life. Swift also has more complex operations you can use, all of
                                them standard mathematical operations, just less common ones. Let’s turn to them
                                now.</p>
                            <p>The first of these is the <em>remainder</em> operation, also called the modulo operation.
                                In division, the denominator goes into the numerator a whole number of times, plus a
                                remainder. This remainder is exactly what the remainder operation gives. For example, 10
                                modulo 3 equals 1, because 3 goes into 10 three times, with a remainder of 1.</p>
                            <p>In Swift, the remainder operator is the <code>%</code> symbol, and you use it like so:
                            </p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
28 % 10
</pre>
                            <p>In this case, the result equals <code>8</code>, because 10 goes into 28 twice with a
                                remainder of 8.</p>
                            <h3>Shift Operations</h3>
                            <p>The <em>shift left</em> and <em>shift right</em> operations take the binary form of a
                                decimal number and shift the digits left or right, respectively. Then they return the
                                decimal form of the new binary number.</p>
                            <p>For example, the decimal number 14 in binary, padded to 8 digits, is
                                <code>00001110</code>. Shifting this left by two places results in <code>00111000</code>,
                                which is 56 in decimal.</p>
                            <p>Here’s an illustration of what happens during this shift operation:</p>
                            <p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/shift_left-650x338.png"
                                    alt="shift_left" width="650" height="338"
                                    class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-143783"
                                    srcset="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/shift_left-650x338.png 650w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/shift_left-480x250.png 480w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/shift_left.png 969w"
                                    sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"/></p>
                            <p>The digits that come in to fill the empty spots on the right become <code>0</code>. The
                                digits that fall off the end on the left are lost.</p>
                            <p>Shifting right is the same, but the digits move to the right.</p>
                            <p>The operators for these two operations are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Shift left: <code><<</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Shift right: <code>>></code>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These are the first operators you’ve seen that contain more than one character. Operators
                                can contain any number of characters, in fact.</p>
                            <p>Here’s an example that uses both of these operators:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
1 &lt;&lt; 3

32 &gt;&gt; 2
</pre>
                            <p>Both of these values equal the number 8.</p>
                            <p>One reason for using shifts is to make multiplying or dividing by powers of two easy.
                                Notice that shifting left by one is the same as multiplying by two, shifting left by two
                                is the same as multiplying by four, and so on. Likewise, shifting right by one is the
                                same as dividing by two, shifting right by two is the same as dividing by four, and so
                                on.</p>
                            <p>In the old days, code often made use of this trick because shifting bits is much simpler
                                for a CPU to do than complex multiplication and division arithmetic. Therefore the code
                                was quicker if it used shifting. However these days, CPUs are much faster and compilers
                                can even convert multiplication and division by powers of two into shifts for you. So
                                you’ll see shifting only for binary twiddling, which you probably won’t see unless you
                                become an embedded systems programmer!</p>
                            <h3>Order of Operations</h3>
                            <p>Of course, it’s likely that when you calculate a value, you’ll want to use multiple
                                operators. Here’s an example of how to do this in Swift:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
((8000 / (5 * 10)) - 32) &gt;&gt; (29 % 5)
</pre>
                            <p>Notice the use of parentheses, which in Swift serve two purposes: to make it clear to
                                anyone reading the code — including yourself — what you meant, and to disambiguate. For
                                example, consider the following:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
350 / 5 + 2
</pre>
                            <p>Does this equal 72 (350 divided by 5, plus 2) or 50 (350 divided by 7)? Those of you who
                                paid attention in school will be screaming “72!” And you would be right!</p>
                            <p>Swift uses the same reasoning and achieves this through what’s known as <em>operator
                                precedence</em>. The division operator (<code>/</code>) has a higher precedence than the
                                addition operator (<code>+</code>), so in this example, the code executes the division
                                operation first.</p>
                            <p>If you wanted Swift to do the addition first — that is, to return 50 — then you could use
                                parentheses like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
350 / (5 + 2)
</pre>
                            <p>The precedence rules follow the same that you learned in math at school. Multiply and
                                divide have the same precedence, higher than add and subtract which also have the same
                                precedence.</p>
                            <h2>Math functions</h2>
                            <p>Swift also has a vast range of math functions for you to use when necessary. You never
                                know when you need to pull out some trigonometry, especially when you’re a pro Swift-er
                                and writing those complex games!</p>
                            <div class="note">
                                <em>Note:</em> Not all of these functions are part of Swift. Some are provided by the
                                operating system. Don’t remove the import statement that comes as part of the playground
                                template or Xcode will tell you it can’t find these functions.
                            </div>
                            <p>For example, consider the following:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
sin(45 * Double.pi / 180)
// 0.7071067811865475

cos(135 * Double.pi / 180)
// -0.7071067811865475
</pre>
                            <p>These compute the sine and cosine respectively. Notice how both make use of <code>Double.pi</code>
                                which is a constant Swift provides us, ready-made with pi to as much precision as is
                                possible by the computer. Neat!</p>
                            <p>Then there’s this:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
sqrt(2.0)
// 1.414213562373095
</pre>
                            <p>This computes the square root of 2. Did you know that sin(45°) equals 1 over the square
                                root of 2?</p>
                            <div class="note">
                                <em>Note:</em> Notice how you used <code>2.0</code> instead of <code>2</code> in the
                                example above? Functions that are provided by the operating systems (like
                                <code>sqrt</code>, <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>) are picky and accept only
                                numbers that contain a decimal point.
                            </div>
                            <p>Not to mention these would be a shame:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
max(5, 10)
// 10

min(-5, -10)
// -10
</pre>
                            <p>These compute the maximum and minimum of two numbers respectively.</p>
                            <p>If you’re particularly adventurous you can even combine these functions like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
max(sqrt(2.0), Double.pi / 2)
// 1.570796326794897
</pre>
                            <h2>Naming Data</h2>
                            <p>At its simplest, computer programming is all about manipulating data. Remember,
                                everything you see on your screen can be reduced to numbers that you send to the CPU.
                                Sometimes you yourself represent and work with this data as various types of numbers,
                                but other times the data comes in more complex forms such as text, images and
                                collections.</p>
                            <p>In your Swift code, you can give each piece of data a name you can use to refer to it
                                later. The name carries with it an associated <em>type</em> that denotes what sort of
                                data the name refers to, such as text, numbers, or a date.</p>
                            <p>You’ll learn about some of the basic types in this part, and you’ll encounter many other
                                types throughout the rest of this series.</p>
                            <h3>Constants</h3>
                            <p>Take a look at this:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
let number: Int = 10
</pre>
                            <p>This declares a constant called <code>number</code> which is of type <code>Int</code>.
                                Then it sets the value of the constant to the number <code>10</code>.</p>
                            <div class="note">
                                <em>Note:</em> Thinking back to operators, here’s another one. The equals sign,
                                <code>=</code>, is known as the <em>assignment operator</em>.
                            </div>
                            <p>The type <code>Int</code> can store integers. The way you store decimal numbers is like
                                so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
let pi: Double = 3.14159
</pre>
                            <p>This is similar to the <code>Int</code> constant, except the name and the type are
                                different. This time, the constant is a <code>Double</code>, a type that can store
                                decimals with high precision.</p>
                            <p>There’s also a type called <code>Float</code>, short for floating point, that stores
                                decimals with lower precision than <code>Double</code>. In fact, <code>Double</code> has
                                about double the precision of <code>Float</code>, which is why it’s called
                                <code>Double</code> in the first place. A <code>Float</code> takes up less memory than a
                                <code>Double</code> but generally, memory use for numbers isn’t a huge issue and you’ll
                                see <code>Double</code> used in most places.</p>
                            <p>Once you’ve declared a constant, you can’t change its data. For example, consider the
                                following code:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
let number: Int = 10
number = 0
</pre>
                            <p>This code produces an error:</p>
                            <div class="note">
                                <code>Cannot assign to value: 'number' is a 'let' constant</code>
                            </div>
                            <p>In Xcode, you would see the error represented this way:</p>
                            <p><img

                                sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"/></p>
                            <p>Constants are useful for values that aren’t going to change. For example, if you were
                                modeling an airplane and needed to keep track of the total number of seats available,
                                you could use a constant.</p>
                            <p>You might even use a constant for something like a person’s age. Even though their age
                                will change as their birthday comes, you might only be concerned with their age at this
                                particular instant.</p>
                            <h3>Variables</h3>
                            <p>Often you want to change the data behind a name. For example, if you were keeping track
                                of your bank account balance with deposits and withdrawals, you might use a variable
                                rather than a constant.</p>
                            <p>If your program’s data never changed, then it would be a rather boring program! But as
                                you’ve seen, it’s not possible to change the data behind a constant.</p>
                            <p>When you know you’ll need to change some data, you should use a variable to represent
                                that data instead of a constant. You declare a variable in a similar way, like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
var variableNumber: Int = 42
</pre>
                            <p>Only the first part of the statement is different: You declare constants using
                                <code>let</code>, whereas you declare variables using <code>var</code>.</p>
                            <p>Once you’ve declared a variable, you’re free to change it to whatever you wish, as long
                                as the type remains the same. For example, to change the variable declared above, you
                                could do this:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
var variableNumber: Int = 42
variableNumber = 0
variableNumber = 1_000_000
</pre>
                            <p>To change a variable, you simply assign it a new value.</p>
                            <div class="note">
                                <em>Note:</em> In Swift, you can optionally use underscores to make larger numbers more
                                human-readable. The quantity and placement of the underscores is up to you.
                            </div>
                            <p>This is a good time to take a closer look at the results sidebar of the playground. When
                                you type the code above into a playground, you’ll see that the results sidebar on the
                                right shows the current value of <code>variableNumber</code> at each line:</p>
                            <p><img
                                src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/variables_results_sidebar-650x76.png"
                                alt="variables_results_sidebar" width="650" height="76"
                                class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-143785"
                                srcset="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/variables_results_sidebar-650x76.png 650w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/variables_results_sidebar-480x56.png 480w, https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/09/variables_results_sidebar.png 757w"
                                sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"/></p>
                            <p>The results sidebar will show a relevant result for each line if one exists. In the case
                                of a variable or constant, the result will be the new value, whether you’ve just
                                declared a constant, or declared or reassigned a variable.</p>
                            <h3>Using Meaningful Names</h3>
                            <p>Always try to choose meaningful names for your variables and constants. Good names can
                                acts as documentation and make your code easy to read.</p>
                            <p>A good name <i>specifically</i> describes what the variable or constant represents. Here
                                are some examples of good names:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <code>personAge</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <code>numberOfPeople</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <code>gradePointAverage</code>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Often a bad name is simply not descriptive enough. Here are some examples of bad
                                names:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <code>a</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <code>temp</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <code>average</code>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The key is to ensure that you’ll understand what the variable or constant refers to when
                                you read it again later. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you have an infallible
                                memory! It’s common in computer programming to look back at your own code as early as a
                                day or two later and have forgotten what it does. Make it easier for yourself by giving
                                your variables and constants intuitive, precise names.</p>
                            <p>Also, note how the names above are written. In Swift, it is common to <em>camel case</em>
                                names. For variables and constants, follow these rules to properly case your names:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Start with a lowercase letter.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If the name is made up of multiple words, join them together and start every other
                                    word with an uppercase letter.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If one of these words is an abbreviation, write the entire abbreviation in the same
                                    case (e.g.: <code>sourceURL</code> and <code>urlDescription</code>)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In Swift, you can even use the full range of Unicode characters. For example, you could
                                declare a variable like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
var : Int = -1
</pre>
                            <p>That might make you laugh, but use caution with special characters like these. They are
                                harder to type and therefore may end up causing you more pain than amusement.</p>

                            <p>Special characters like these probably make more sense in <i>data</i> that you store
                                rather than in Swift code.</p>
                            <h2>Increment and Decrement</h2>
                            <p>A common operation that you will need is to be able to increment or decrement a variable.
                                In Swift, this is achieved like so:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
var counter: Int = 0

counter += 1
// counter = 1

counter -= 1
// counter = 0
</pre>
                            <p>The <code>counter</code> variable begins as <code>0</code>. The increment sets its value
                                to <code>1</code>, and then the decrement sets its value back to <code>0</code>.</p>
                            <p>These operators are similar to the assignment operator (<code>=</code>), except they also
                                perform an addition or subtraction. They take the current value of the variable, add or
                                subtract the given value and assign the result to the variable.</p>
                            <p>In other words, the code above is shorthand for the following:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
var counter: Int = 0
counter = counter + 1
counter = counter - 1
</pre>
                            <p>Similarly, the <code>*=</code> and <code>/=</code> operators do the equivalent for
                                multiplication and division, respectively:</p>
                            <pre lang="swift">
var counter: Int = 10

counter *= 3  // same as counter = counter * 3
// counter = 30

counter /= 2  // same as counter = counter / 2
// counter = 15
</pre>

                            <p>If you haven’t been following along with the code in Xcode, now’s the time to create a
                                new playground and try some exercises to test yourself!</p>

                                    integer you’d like. Next, create another constant called <code>evenOdd</code> and
                                    set it equal to <code>testNumber</code> modulo 2. Now change <code>testNumber</code>
                                    to various numbers. What do you notice about <code>evenOdd</code>?

                                    Increment it by <code>1</code>. Add <code>10</code> to it. Multiply it by
                                    <code>10</code>. Then, shift it to the right by <code>3</code>. After all of these
                                    operations, what’s the answer?
